create a folder/dir ( my system is linux based )
mkdir myfirstterraformproject
inside folder/dir create file named main.tf
and paste the following code in it

code

provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket" "first_bucket" {
  bucket = "hariom12380-first-bucket"
}

code

in the same dir in whuch main.tf is saved

run the following command:
