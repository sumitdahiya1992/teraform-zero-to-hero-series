output

code

output "message" {
  value = "Hello-Teraaform-User"
}

code


Try running this project by opening your terminal. Changing directory into the folder that you
created where the main.tf file is and then running terraform init and terraform apply. You will
see that Terraform runs and then prints the following:

Apply complete! Resources: 0 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.

Outputs:

message = Hello-Terraform-user

OUTPUT RESOURCE PROPERTIES

The first example is pretty basic and in the real world probably not very useful. Outputs are much
more useful when used to output the values of resources that have been created as part of a Terraform
run. Lets create another Terraform project and do that. Create a new folder and create a single
file called main.tf then paste in the following code

CODE

provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"
}

resource "aws-s3-bucket" "first_bucket"
  bucket = "kelholditch-bucket-output"
}

output "bucket_name" {
 value = "aws_s3_bucket.first_bucket.id
}

output "bucket_arn" {
  value = "aws_s3_bucket.first_bucket.arn
}

output "bucket_information" {
  value = "bucket name: ${aws_s3_bucket.first_bucket.id}, bucket arn: ${aws_s3_bucket.first_bucket.arn}"
}
